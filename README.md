## protocaml

this project is aimed at a serializer/deserializer for Protocol Buffers, as well as an OCaml
Protobuf library for interacting with Protocol Buffers from within OCaml. not sure if that 
is a repetitive statement as I'm still learning the ins and outs of Protobuf


## goals

my goals with this project are mainly to learn more OCaml and Protobuf.

-[ ] code generation (generating Protobuf interfaces in OCaml given `.proto`s)
-[ ] only using OCaml's standard library
-[ ] serializing and deserializing Protobuf binaries
